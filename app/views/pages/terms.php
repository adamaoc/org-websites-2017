    <h2>The gist:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Your ORG-Websites Account and Website. If you create a blog or website on ORG-Websites.com, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and blog, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the blog. You must immediately notify ORG-Websites of any unauthorized uses of your blog, your account, or any other breaches of security. ORG-Websites will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</li>
      <li>Responsibility of Contributors. If you operate a blog, comment on a blog, post material to ORG-Websites.com, post links on ORG-Websites.com, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using ORG-Websites.com, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms or the User Guidelines. By submitting Content to ORG-Websites for inclusion on your website, you grant ORG-Websites a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your blog. This license allows ORG-Websites to make publicly-posted content available to third parties selected by ORG-Websites (through the ORG-Websites Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) your content through their services. You also give other ORG-Websites.com users permission to share your Content on other ORG-Websites.com websites and add their own Content to it (aka to reblog your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website (the reblogging function on ORG-Websites.com does this automatically!). If you delete Content, ORG-Websites will use reasonable efforts to remove it from ORG-Websites.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, ORG-Websites has the right (though not the obligation) to, in ORG-Websites’s sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website’s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in ORG-Websites’s reasonable opinion, violates any ORG-Websites policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of ORG-Websites.com to any individual or entity for any reason. ORG-Websites will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</li>
      <li>Attribution. ORG-Websites reserves the right to display attribution text or links in your site footer or toolbar, attributing ORG-Websites.com or the theme author, for example. The toolbar may not be altered or removed.</li>
    </ul>
