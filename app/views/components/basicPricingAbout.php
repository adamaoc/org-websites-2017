<p>At ORG-Websites, we know how difficult it is to manage money for non-profits. You want as much going back out as you're taking in and sometimes a beautiful website is way down on your list. We want to make it as cheap and easy to get you started. This offer sets you up with a basic WordPress install on our shared server. You'll be able to pick from the hundreds of WordPress templates already offered for free or purchase one from one of the many theme outlets.</p>

<p>To help you get started and give you some direction we will also schedule a one-on-one consultation where you get to speak directly to one of our experts about things like social media, SEO, and building a brand. You'll also have access to our Intro to WordPress video to help get you familiar with the platform.</p>
